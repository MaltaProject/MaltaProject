 * Character Selection:
 * Race -> Class -> SubClass -> Religion

===Character Generation===

Character generation happens when a player creates a new character. The process 
follows a strict sequence in order to fulfill the dependencies required for each
step.

The generator first decides the race of the character and generates the stats 
specific to that race. It then moves on, letting the user pick the class. Since
some classes are only available to certain races, this must come second. The 
generator then picks the lowest subclass for the chosen class and adds it to the
user's profile. The next selection is the user's religion.

===User Stats===
==Protection Stats==
The base of a protection stat is first determined from values stored in the 
user's profile based on the user's race. This stat will be an integer. To
determine the total protection value, the base stat will be multiplied agaist
all the protection modifiers found in the both the object's the user is wearing
and the user's religion & class. 

Protection stats are always percents with the exception of the base value found
in the user's profile. Since the value found in the user's profile is generated
from the race at character generation, the race stats must also be an integer.
