===What Stats DO===
Dexterity
Determines whether or not you can get a strike in against the NPC.
If your dexterity is too low compared to the NPC's value, it is 
unlikely you will be able to hit them. While if your dexterity is
much higher than the NPC they will have a harder time hitting you.

TODO: Make weight a factor in dexterity calculations

Intelligence
Intelligence allows user to see traps, catch thieves. Intelligence
is also used to calculate whether you are able to flee an enemy if
caught in combat. Finally, intelligence can also allow the user to 
haggle the price if they know the haggle skill.

Strength
When using pierce or ranged weapons, strength will give the user an 
additional bonus as they will be able to put more force behind their
weapon.

Wisdom
Wisdom is used by magicians. Magicians that have a high level of wisdom
will regenerate mana more quickly and have more powerful magical attacks.

Make forest of living trees to fight - Babin's idea

Make haggle skill.

/*
 * On startup of the server, the server should delete the instanceNPC file and then recurse through
 * the rooms and regenerate all NPC's. This will prevent accidental loss of NPC's over time due to an
 * NPC being killed at the same time as the NPC list being regenerated.
 * 
 * The program could also wipe the who file of every room on startup as well as the server who file.
 * 
 * GameKeeper will now regenerate NPC's -- need to add time delay
